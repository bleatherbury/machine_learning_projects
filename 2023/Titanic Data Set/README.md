# About
The Titanic dataset is used for data analysis and machine learning. It contains data on passengers who were on board when it sank on it's maiden voyage. This data set includes the following information.

1. Passenger Information: This includes the name, age, sex, and passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd class) of each passenger. 
2. Survival Status: Indicates whether the passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
3. Ticket Information: Details about the passenger's ticket, such as fare paid and ticket number.
4. Cabin Information: Cabin number where the passenger stayed.
5. Embarked: The port where the passenger boarded the Titanic. (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

The objective here is to build a predictive model to determine which passengers survived this disaster based on the available features. I have trained several models here and found that the ensemble method seems to work best in this instance.
